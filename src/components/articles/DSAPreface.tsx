      <h2>Series Preface</h2>
      <p>
        In this series we will be breaking down how nine of the most common
        sorting algorithms work and implementing them from scratch in
        JavaScript. Algorithms can often stress people out, but don't worry! If
        you have a basic understanding of JavaScript, you'll be good to go!
      </p>
      <p>
        Please keep in mind, the code in this series is for demonstrative
        purposes only and should not be used in production. In the overwhelming
        majority of cases, you will want to opt for one of the sorting
        algorithms built-in to your language of choice rather than rolling your
        own.
