## Prerequisites

The only assumption this articles makes is that you understand the basics of HTML and CSS. If you are familiar with HTML elements
and basic CSS selectors like `p` or `.blue-text` and CSS properties like font size or width, you will be totally fine.

## Building Up Our Mental Model

The most accurate way to describe an HTML document is in the shape of a tree. It begins with the `html` element and each element
in the document is a descedent of that tree. Visually, this is shown below.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <Image src={htmlTree} alt="A tree diagram of a simple HTML document" />
</div>

Although this graphic does not display the nesting in the most accurate way, this is the natural form of an HTML document and
how it is represented by the document object model (DOM). But let's put that in our back pocket, for now, because it is irrelevent
to the way I want you to think about things for the context of this article.

Instead, I want you to think of your HTML document not too dissimilar from a set of Matreshka dolls.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <Image src={dolls} alt="A line of Matreshka dolls" />
</div>

I like to believe everyone's grandmother had a set of these funny little dolls in their home, but in case anyone is unfamiliar
allow me a brief detour. The largest of the dolls is often referred to as the mother doll and represents the matriarch of a family.
Open her up, and you will find a slightly smaller doll, and then again and again to reach the smallest.

The way we outline the layout and components of our user interfaces is very similar. Re-visiting the earlier graphic, our `html`
element is the largest box that contains our entire document. Nested inside is the `body` element, which in turn contains our other
elements such as a paragraph or a list. This is the foundation of the CSS box model which is the system browsers use to determine
how to render a piece of UI, namely it's dimensions.

## Quick Note: Positioning

The information presented from this point down will refer exclusively to items which are statically positioned, which is the
default for all elements unless explicitly changed. The rationale for this is that positions of `absolute` or `relative` have
very nuanced behavior and will eventually be an article all their own. Understanding static position first will lay a solid
foundation that makes debugging those quirkier setups significantly easier.

Flex and grid will be omitted for the same reason.

## Display Types: Block and Inline

The first step of conceptualizing the box model is understanding the various types of elements you may potentially use.

The most common type of element are `block` level elements, with a few common examples beinf `div`, `p`, and `ul` elements.
The default behavior of a block level element is that it's height is equal to it's content (more on this later) and it spans the
entire width of it's parent container. You are also able to set alternative values for the `height`, `width`, `margin`, and `padding`
properties. Even if you override one of these properties, such as setting the width to 50%, the browser will insert a line break after
each element so each block element will appear under the one before.

An alternative is an inline element, some common examples being `span` or `img`. The default behavior of these elements is that they do not
receive the line break after each element like `block` level do, and each element appear one after the other. Your options for customization
are more constained as well, as you can apply margin and padding to the left or right side, but placing either on the top or bottom is ignored
by the browser. You also cannot apply modifiations to their width or their height.

<b>Slight Gotcha</b>: Although you can't override the height of an inline
element, the height is not necessarily static. For example, if you put a span
with a small amount of text on either side of an image, the container will grow
to the height of the image, and the text will appear at the bottom.

There is a hybrid of both of these types, called `inline-block`. The primary difference is that inline-block elements will still appear side-by-side,
but you are able to apply a width or height. Padding and margin can also be applied to the top and bottom as well, not simply the left and right.

## Box Sizing and the Box Model

Now with the foundation out of the way, we are going to turn the boxception up to 11. In addition to being able to think of each
element in the document as being boxes inside of boxes, each element is also composed of a few smaller boxes: `margin`, `padding`, `content`, and `border` boxes.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <Image
    src={boxModel}
    alt="A diagram of the box model showing each box that composes the element"
  />

</div>

As the name suggests, the content box is the very-most center box that actually houses the content, like the text inside of a paragraph. Skipping over one box, the border box wraps around the content box. Even if there is no border (ie, `border: none`),
this box is still present. Then finally our padding is the space that sits between the content box and the border box, while margin
is outside of the border box.

### Practical Exercise

Let's step through a simple excercise that is an example of where most, if not all, CSS newbies get bitten by box sizing. Suppose
you create a `div` in your code and apply the following styles:

```css
.example {
  width: 100px;
  padding: 25px;
  border: 3px solid #000;
}
```

Wait a minute... now our `div` has an actual rendered width of `156px`. What just happened?

The default box sizing model used by the browser is called `content-box` sizing. This means that adjustments to height or width are applied to the content box. Remember that this is our inner most box and margin, padding, and border boxes will all add additional size as directed by our other CSS rules. So the CSS ruleset above gives us an initial content box
size of `100px` but then adds `25px` of padding to the left and right side, and finally `3px` of border to the left and right side which produces our final calculated width of `156px`.

## An Alternative: Border Box Sizing

There is an alternative to a `box-sizing` of `content-box` and that is border box sizing. Nothing changes about the behaviors described above such as inline level elements versus block level elements, but instead of our `width` property being applied to the content box, it is applied to the border box.

With a small tweak to the CSS above:

```css
.example {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  width: 100px;
  padding: 25px;
  border: 3px solid #000;
}
```

Our `div` now has the expected width of 100px. But make note of the fact that other attributes such as margin or padding still apply, so this model now works in reverse. What do I mean by that? Essentially just that now instead of the additional 28 pixels being applied to the base width of 100 pixels, those values are now subtracted from the content box. So the content box of the element was reduced to just 44 pixels. So keep this in mind.

That said, I and a lot of other people who work with CSS feel as though this is still a much more sensible mental model.
Because of this, a lot of CSS frameworks, CSS resets, and CSS normalizers will automatically set the box sizing of all elements to `border-box`. If the behavior of the example above seemed strange or unexpected, you may already be using something like `normalize.css` that resets this default.

You can accomplish this with the following CSS:

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

## Conclusion

As a reminder, there are other scenarios where behavior will deviate from the above. Such as setting the display property on an element to alternatives like `flex`, `grid`, `inline-flex`, or `inline-grid`. CSS is a simple language syntatically, but can become complicated because of the nuance of it's behavior and the browsers interpretation of your rule sets, but I hope now you feel more confident in your ability to style things how you wish and more consistently
nail the expected outcome.
