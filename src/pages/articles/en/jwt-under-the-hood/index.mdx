## Prerequisites

The only necessary prerequisite knowledge for this article is a familiarity with JavaScript, the code examples
will not feature any advanced concepts. A high level understanding of cryptography and hashing is helpful, but not
strictly required as we will discuss the cliff notes.

## What is a JSON Web Token?

JSON Web Tokens, which we will refer to as JWTs (pronounced JOT) going forward is defined on [jwt.io](https://jwt.io)
as follows:

> JSON Web Tokens are an open, industry standard RFC 7519 method for representing claims securely between two parties.

Let's break that down a little bit. A claim in this context is simply a bit of information about a system, for example,
the user ID and permissions of a logged in user stored as a key-value pair. This example may look something like this:

```json
{
  "userId": 12512613,
  "scopes": "user.account, user.post"
}
```

A <abbr title="JOT">JWT</abbr> is a way of representing this information and sharing it between systems in a way
that is secure and URL-safe meaning it can be shared in a URL, like a query string in a HTTP request. An important
note: when I say secure, I am referring to security of validation and freshness, but not necessarily secure from a
data perspective. What does that mean?

## Quick Aside: Cryptographic Signing and JWT Security

In cryptography at a high level, there are two approaches you can take. Encryption is the process of using a secret
such as a key to obfuscate a bit of information, and then the same secret can be later used by the receiving party
to decrypt the information back into it's original form. The second is hashing, which is intentionally one-direction
and cannot be decrypted after. To verify correctness, the same information must be hashed again and compared to the
original.

### Practical Example

When you sign-up for a website and that website needs to store your password, that password is
stored in the database in a hashed format. For example, the password "password" hashed with SHA256
would be this:

```
5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8
```

Then when you go to login again, they cannot decrypt this password, so they apply the same hashing algorithm
and compare the resulting hash to the hash stored in the database. Given the same input, a stable hash will always
produce the same output.

### Cryptographic Signing

The cryptographic signing is what creates the security of a JWT. I will elaborate more on how the signature is
generated shortly. But the short and skinny for now is that if the signature of a JWT is determined to be incorrect
then it is an indicator that the JWT has been tampered with and should be discarded.

This is what I meant by JWTs do not ensure security of data, because as we will also look at shortly, the data is
available behind Base64 encoding and can be decoded. So you should never store sensitive data directly inside of a token.

## The Anatomy of a JSON Web Token

A JWT is composed of three unique pieces that are concatenated together by a period,

### Header

The header contains metadata about the claim that is necessary in order to attempt to validate and consume a token.
It typically contains the type or `typ` of the token and the signing algorithm used to generate the signature
represented by `alg`. An example of this in JSON would look like this:

```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

This lets the receiving party know that this token is a JWT and that the HS256 algorithm was used to generate the signature.

### Payload

The payload of the token is the actual claim or the data that needs to be shared between two collaborating parties.
There are a few reserved keys for important information that may or may not be applicable to your use case such as:

| Key |                       Value                        |
| --- | :------------------------------------------------: |
| exp |  The UNIX timestamp of the expiration date & time  |
| iss | The name of the issuing party that created the JWT |

Alternatively, you can create your own key-value pairs that will contain whatever information may be relevant to your
needs, keeping in mind the note above about this information being easily visible on intercepted tokens. Most libraries
will accept any valid string for a key or a value, but JWTs are designed to be small and concise, so claim keys should
be kept to a minimum. In keeping with the example at the opening of this post, our claim might look something like this:

```json
{
  "userId": 12512613,
  "scopes": "user.account, user.post",
  "exp": 1671928422
}
```

This represents our original data and states that the token will expire in 3 days from the time of me typing this.

### Signature

After the header and payload are Base64 encoded, the final step in creating a JWT is to use the signing algorithm
specified in the header to create a hash of the header and payload concatenated together with a period. Some
hashing algorithms such as SHA256 or MD5 just accept an input, but signing algorithms like HS256 also accept a secret
that is used as part of the process. So if you take the same header and payload and encrypt with the key "jody", and
then with the key "javavscript", you will get two different hashes.

If someone intercepts the token and attempts to modify the payload before re-transmitting, the receiving party would
be able to determine this because generating a new signature from the received header and payload would not match the
signature of the token. If the interceptor has the secret, then they can flawlessly produce a new token. But this is
not an issue unique to JWT and why you should always treat your token's `secret` with the seriousness you do your
ATM PIN or online banking password.

The example header and payload above, signed with HS256 algorithm and secret "jody" would produce the following token.
I have added extra spaces and newlines after each section to be more easily read.

## Writing Our Own JWT Library Disclaimer

The remainder of this article is focused on implementing our own micro-library that is capable of generating,
validating, and if valid outputting the contents of a JWT. It's important to note that this is strictly a
learning exercise because one of the best ways to understand something is to implement it yourself.

That said, this code will not be production worthy and should not be used as such. If you are writing an
application that generates or consumes JWTs, you should use an appropriate and battle tested library for your tech
stack. I am predominantly a TypeScript and Node developer so [jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken)
from Auth0 is my preferred weapon of choice.

## Making Our Plan

Now that we have some background context on a JWT and how it functions. Let's start with a basic plan of what our
micro-library needs to be able to accomplish. For the sake of brevity we are going to focus on the following
core behaviors that any JWT library will have:

- Generate a token with the HS256 signing algorithm
- Given a valid token, return the payload of the token
- Given a token that has expired, fail verification and return `false`
- Given a token that has been tampered with in some way, fail verification and return `false`

For the "Show Me The Code!" reader, the [entire source](https://github.com/jodylecompte/lesson-jwt-under-the-hood)
can be found on Github.

We will be using the crypto module that is built-in to Node for the signature generation. Everyone has a preferred
way of building simple Node apps, so I am going to skip that portion, but if you are unfamiliar with building a
Node app locally then [repl.it](https://repl.it) is a free and easy way to get up and running.

## Getting Started and Base64 Encoding

The first step will be creating a new file and writing our functions to Base64 encode. Create a file called `jwt.js`
and populate it with the following:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function base64Encode(obj) {
  return Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(obj)).toString('base64url');
}

function base64Decode(encoded) {
  return JSON.parse(Buffer.from(encoded, 'base64url').toString());
}
```

I am not using any sort of tooling or build-step so I am just using CommonJS modules to import the built-in `crypto`
package, but depending on your setup and preference you can use the `import` syntax instead.

Since we know we will be working with string representations of our data, that is baked into the functions so
when we encode we convert the object into a JSON string, and parse back into an object when decoded. A `Buffer` is
a JavaScript data structure used for storing a fixed-length sequence of binary data. It is capable of being constructed
from a string or a Base64 encoded string and outputting either making for a convenient way to handle our encoding.

## Generating a Signature And Signing

The next step now that we have encoded the first two sections of our token, we need to generate a signature
based on our secret key. I am super stoked that the crypto package has been folded into Node's standard libraries
because it has a very simple and intuitive API.

```javascript
function generateSignature(body, secret) {
  return crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret).update(body).digest('base64url');
}
```

The `createHmac` function accepts the type of algorithm we want to use for hashing and our secret key, the `update`
function accepts the hash contents to generate our signature.

The next step is just a matter of using the functions we have already defined to put everything together.

```javascript
function sign(header, payload, secret) {
  const encodedHeader = base64Encode(header);
  const encodedPayload = base64Encode(payload);
  const signature = generateSignature(
    encodedHeader + '.' + encodedPayload,
    secret
  );
  return `${encodedHeader}.${encodedPayload}.${signature}`;
}
```

## Verifying a JWT

The final functionality we need is the ability to verify based on the steps we outlined in the plan. We are
taking a very "sunny-day" approach and assuming input will always be a "valid" (structurally) JWT.

```javascript
function verify(token, secret) {
  const [header, payload, signature] = token.split('.');

  const decodedHeader = base64Decode(header);
  const decodedPayload = base64Decode(payload);

  if (generateSignature(header + '.' + payload, secret) !== signature) {
    return false;
  }

  if (decodedPayload.hasOwnProperty('exp') && decodedPayload.exp < Date.now()) {
    return false;
  }

  return {
    header: decodedHeader,
    payload: decodedPayload,
  };
}
```

After we split our token and destructure it into its three pieces, we can go ahead and decode our header and payload.
At this point, we aren't actually sure if the token is even trust-worthy, it's possible it's been tampered with. But
we need to know if there is an expiration property on the claim to ensure it's not expired. Additionally, if this
were a more feature-packed library, we would need the `alg` property off of the header to know which algorithm to use
to verify the signature.

You may be thinking, "What if a bad actor took an expired token and modified the expiration to be in the future?"
Great question! That is why the first step we take is to feed the still encoded header, payload, and our secret
key back into `generateSignature`. If the resulting signature does not match the signature we receive, the token
has been tampered with and we just return false.

Knowing now our token is trust-worthy, we can check if we have an expiration and if the token is expired. Since
the value will be a UNIX timestamp (seconds since UNIX epoch), we can simply compare it to `Date.now()` to see
if the token expiration is in the past. If so, we also return false.

Finally, if we have not early returned on error by now, the token is valid and secure and we return the header and
payload.

## Testing Time!

We are both far too skilled to do something like writing bugs, but we should probably test our code a little bit
just to be on the safe side! In your project, create a file with the following contents:

```javascript
const jwt = require('./jwt');

const header = {
  alg: 'HS256',
  typ: 'JWT',
};

const payload = {
  userId: 12512613,
  scopes: 'user.account, user.post',
};

const expiredPayload = {
  userId: 12512613,
  scopes: 'user.account, user.post',
  exp: 1671509615,
};

// Case 1. Should generate a valid JWT
const token = jwt.sign(header, payload, 'jody');
console.log(
  'Expect: ',
  'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOjEyNTEyNjEzLCJzY29wZXMiOiJ1c2VyLmFjY291bnQsIHVzZXIucG9zdCJ9.S06zS8YnqN6HK8F_U8s_9LgzN0acuLuh-H8tE3_w3VI'
);
console.log('Actual: ', token);
console.log('\n');

// Case 2. Given a valid token, return the payload of the token
const { header: caseTwoHeader, payload: caseTwoPayload } = jwt.verify(
  token,
  'jody'
);
console.log('Expected: ', { header, payload });
console.log('Actual: ', { header: caseTwoHeader, payload: caseTwoPayload });
console.log('\n');

// Case 3. Given a token that has expired, fail verification and return false
const expiredToken = jwt.sign(header, expiredPayload, 'jody');
const parsedExpiredToken = jwt.verify(expiredToken, 'jody');
console.log('Expected: ', false);
console.log('Actual: ', parsedExpiredToken);
console.log('\n');

// Case 4. Given a token that has been tampered with in some way, fail verification and return false
const tamperedToken =
  'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOjEyNTExMjQxMiwic2NvcGVzIjoidXNlci5hY2NvdW50LCB1c2VyLnBvc3QifQ.S06zS8YnqN6HK8F_U8s_9LgzN0acuLuh-H8tE3_w3VI';
const parsedTamperedToken = jwt.verify(tamperedToken, 'jody');
console.log('Expected: ', false);
console.log('Actual: ', parsedTamperedToken);
```

The code is just a re-hashing of what we have already discussed, so a play by play probably ins't necessary but
just a little extra context around the above cases:

1. The same header, payload, and secret were fed into the interactive tool at [jwt.io](https://jwt.io) to establish
   a known correct token to compare to.
2. The expiration is omitted so that we know for certain the token will be valid and not expired.
3. The token expired weeks ago, giving us another known error case.
4. I manually changed the payload of the previous token to use another user ID so that the signature would be invalid.

## Conclusion

You've probably utilized JWTs before and maybe didn't even realize what it was or pay too much attention to it,
I definitely did! It's not often that you could read the full RFC for a standard and write a bare-bones implementation
in a single sitting. It's always great when our tools are so simple. Now that you know the whole picture, a JWT
no longer has to be a black box.
