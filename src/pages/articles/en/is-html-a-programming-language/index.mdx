## Sorry, You Just Got Click-baited

You may have clicked this article to see if my opinions matched your own, or maybe you wanted to get angry with me and call me a
gatekeeper. The truth of the matter is, the classification of whether HTML is a programming language or not matters very
little to me and I won't be making an assertion in favor or against HTML's classification.

But now that you are here, can we talk about the common arguments and how it leads to bad feelings and exclusion?

## The Premise

Of all the arguments in favor of HTML being a programming language, the most common is that if you say HTML is not a programming
language then you are de-valuing the skills of people who write HTML and making people feel bad by calling them fake programmers and
that you are decreasing the value of HTML overall.

This is one of those statements that at a high level sounds good. Nobody, well mostly nobody, wants to make beginners feel bad. Or to
make anyone feel bad about their skills or their abilities. However, it also sets a very dangerous precedent in the form of the idea that
if "X" is not a programming language, then it is not valuable.

What does this mean for the members of the tech community that very seldom or don't write code at all?

## Technology is More Than Code

I think people get so engrained in their particular niche, like web development, machine learning, or systems programming, that it's
easy to lose track of how sophisticated of a dependency web modern computer information systems have. Focusing in on the web specifically,
because that's my particular area of expertise, it takes a significant amount of work from a vast set of disciplines to go from an icon on
a desktop to a feature-rich web application or website.

If technical writers who prepare documentation were too suddenly disappear off the face of the planet, developer productivity would plummet
drastically because we'd all be stuck either implementing our own tools from scratch or reading the source code to derive usage patterns.

Even if you classify configuration languages like YAML as programming as well, there are a significant number of network engineers and infrastructure
specialists that do not write code at all. I used AWS for several years before most of their automation tools were accepted as production grade.

I could make a few more examples, but I fear at this point I may be kicking a dead horse. The underlying point across all examples is the same -- the
work we do is important whether it happens in a code editor, a platform-as-a-service GUI interface, a content management system, or a board room.

## HTML is Intrinsically Valuable

HTML is the literal foundation of the web. Here is an example of what the web would look like without HTML, only slightly better than what the
web would look like without electricity.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <Image src={blankWebPage} alt="A browser showing a completely blank page" />
</div>

Even if you use a framework like React where you are writing in a superset of HTML, or some other compile-to-HTML technology stack, HTML
is still the 100% necessary platform primitive that gets the entire rodeo started. This is where the value of HTML and the value of people
who know HTML comes from, not from it's arbitrary classification on a wall of labeled boxes.

## Conclusion

This may seem like a nitpick or being overly pedantic, and in some ways perhaps it is. But I was raised by my mother, an English teacher, to
believe that words are the most powerful things on the planet. The internet is not typically a place for nuance, and platforms like Twitter
with extremely restrictive character limits exacerbate this problem.

It's also helpful to remember that there are over 7 billion of us speaking literally thousands of languages. What may be a perfectly clear statement
between two English speakers may have an unexpected meaning or impact on someone whose native tongue is not English.

It's definitely possible to empower and support people without inadvertently breaking down others.
