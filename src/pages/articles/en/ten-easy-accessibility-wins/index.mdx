## Prerequisites

Only a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are necessary. This article is going to focus on easy wins and low
hanging fruit that will not only make your site more accessible, but also improve the accessibility of your future work without
taking any significant amount of extra time.

## Accessibility-First Preface

When I write topics around low hanging fruit or being more accessible without using any additional time, I often feel a little strange
about it. So I feel obligated to include this preface. Accessibility is not a "solvable problem" in the sense that you check some boxes
and it's done. The diversity of people, abilities, disabilities, devices, and assistive technology is too vast. It requires continued
learning and improvements that often take time to learn and time to implement.

That said, I am also a firm believer in what I've come to call "accessibility-first" development where simple tweaks to your workflow can make
things significantly more accessible without using any additional time. I am not advocating for avoiding this reality, hoping to encourage
people will how easy it can be to get started and make first steps.

## 1. Install Accessibility Testing Tools

While not technically an "easy win", it's an important step one to ensure you not go into battle without your sword or your shield. Accessibility
testing tools can be extremely helpful in helping you catch overlooked or missed problems as close to them occurring as possible. The longer
after the fact and the more work that is completed before these sorts of issues get fixed, the more time it will take when the check comes due.

A few of my favorites:

- [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) - A powerful tool for identifying almost everything if not everything browser developer
  tools can detect, available free as an extension to all major browsers. I like to run through any touched pages before each merge request to ensure
  the small and easy details are taken care of first
- [aXe DevTools](https://www.deque.com/) - A comprehensive suite of tools ranging from feature parity with other free tools in their free tier, but also
  tools for continuos integration and deployment pipelines, automated testing, code linting, mobile application accessibility tools, and even live site
  monitoring.
- [EsLint](https://eslint.org/) - If you are working in JavaScript, you are probably already using ESLint. You can also use custom rule packages
  like [eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y) to help keep an eye on issues
  in real time as you are coding. If you are particularly masochistic like I may be, then you can also configure your setup to fail builds due to
  accessibility issues. If you are not a React developer, or not working heavily in JavaScript, I'm sure there are similar tools for your stack of
  choice.

**Important note:** Automated testing can typically only capture the lowest tier of errors. The tools above are extremely helpful, but should not
be considered exhaustive. Even after an all clear from the above tools, manual testing is still necessary.

## 2. Alt Tag Your Images and Your Icons

It may be surprising to see something like including alt tags on images in this list or similar lists, but when I am
doing audits, it is very rare I work on a website that doesn't have a few missing alt tags. If you are conveying important
information in the means of an image without an alt tag, then non-visual users are left out.

To the credit of the average programmer, I see this far more often with icons more so than regular images. Depending on your needs,
there are multiple ways you can attack this problem.

Does the image not convey any meaningful information? Just hide it. For example, the images featured at the top of each of my blog posts
has the exact same text (more or less) as the article headline, so there is no real value to a screen reader reading it to the user twice.
So I give those images an empty alt attribute and use the `aria-hidden` attribute to hide the images from the accessibility API.

In the case of icons, my personal preference is to use a wrapper component that adds `aria-hidden` to the icon and then show a text label
that is hidden from visual users. The following screen reader ony class is my go-to, written by [Chris Coyier](https://twitter.com/chriscoyier) of
[CSS Tricks](https://csstricks.com).

```css
.sr-only:not(:focus):not(:active) {
  clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
  clip-path: inset(50%);
  height: 1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  position: absolute;
  white-space: nowrap;
  width: 1px;
}
```

Alternatively, you can just add a `title` or `aria-label` to your icon, but the reason I dislike this icon is because some screen readers will still
announce that an image is there, when the more important information is the behavior. More on this soon in #6 and #9.

## 3. Responsiveness for Zoom

With the idea of "mobile first" being probably a decade old at this point, I think most developers are definitely considering mobile responsiveness
in their designs, but have you ever tested your site on higher than 100% zoom?

Users that have difficulty reading smaller text size may utilize a magnifying lens style app, they may zoom the entire page in, or may use browser settings
to increase the base font-size of the entire document. Most people have already adopted using responsive units like rems for font-size, which allows
all your typography to scale with these changes, but special care can often be needed with media queries.

A good way to think of this is to imagine the user has the browser full screened and the current viewport width is 1500 pixels; after zooming in to 200%,
they are now effectively working with 750 pixels and should probably be seeing a mobile or tablet view rather than a significantly and possibly less usable
desktop view.

While the solutions to these sorts of problems are easy enough to make this list, it is a surprisingly in-depth topic. For a deeper understanding of
measurement units in regards to accessibility, I highly recommend
[The Surprising Truth about Pixels And Accessibility](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/surprising-truth-about-pixels-and-accessibility/).

## 4. Be Mindful of Color Contrast

Before diving into color contrast, it's probably useful to do a quick detour into WCAG conformance levels because I am consistently asked the question,
"Do my colors need to be AA or AAA?". In the majority of cases, AA conformance is more than adequate. AAA is reserved for special circumstances only
and there are content types that cannot be expressed in AAA conformance.

The color contrast ratio is the ratio between the background and foreground color. In situations involving any color blindness or even just diminished
eye-sight in general, low contrast can be very difficult to read. You should strive for a contrast ratio matching the following table.

| Level | Normal Text | Large Text | UI Components |
| ----- | ----------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| AA    | 4:5:1       | 3:1        | 3:1           |
| AAA   | 7:1         | 4.5:1      | Unknown       |

Large text is defined as 14 point (typically 18.66px) and bold or larger, or 18 point (typically 24px) or larger. UI Components refers details such as
the focus outline state of a form input.

There are multiple ways to discover color contrast issues. All browser developer tools with accessibility tool suites as well as the tools mentioned
above will detect insufficient contrast. [Fontanello](https://fontanello.app/) is one of my favorite tools for this because I quickly highlight a piece
of text, right click, and the context menu will have a section that shows me all the data about that piece of typography including its contrast ratio.

The thing that makes this hard is from a design standpoint but also from a client facing standpoint where companies can be very passionate about their
brand color choices. Which is why I love this particular [Accessible Color Generator](https://www.learnui.design/tools/accessible-color-generator.html)
the best because you can input your current background and foreground color and find the closest valid match for your desired WCAG conformance level.

## 5. Everything Should Be Keyboard Navigable

Keyboard navigation in web user interfaces is a big one, because not only does it allow people who may only use a keyboard and not a mouse for
any number of reasons, but also power users like the Linux gurus that see reaching for the mouse as a capital offense.

### Use the Platform When You Can

A lot of the time, we get that keyboard navigation for free by making use of the platform. For example, given a regular old datepicker input:

```html
<input type="date" />
```

You get a plethora of built-in features:

1. The date can be entered completely as text via keyboard
2. You can tab between day/month/year in the text input or press space to enter the actual calendar
3. You can tab between the various actions in the calendar like switching to the year drop down or accessing the month view
4. The calendar can be closed by the Esc key or space after focusing on the cancel anchor
5. Navigate between days using the arrow keys
6. Elements all have visible focus state to indicate when focus has been moved by a keyboard.

But if you make the decision for any reason to create your own date picker or to utilize a third party date picker, you need to be aware that behavior
was thrown away and will have to be re-implemented and steps will potentially be deliberately skipped or un-intentionally missed. This doesn't mean
never use third-party or always use the platform, development is nuanced. But it is something to be aware of, I dive a bit deeper into this in number 10.

### What Does Keyboard Navigation Include?

When unsure of what keyboard behavior may be expected, the ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG) often has great documentation to help, for example, the
documentation for an [Accordion Example](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/example-index/accordion/accordion) has the following table:

| Key            | Function                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Space or Enter | When focus is on the accordion header of a collapsed section, expands the section.                                                       |
| Tab            | - Moves focus to the next focusable element. <br /> - All focusable elements in the accordion are included in the page Tab sequence.     |
| Shift + Tab    | - Moves focus to the previous focusable element. <br /> - All focusable elements in the accordion are included in the page Tab sequence. |

The list should not be treated as exhaustive, there may be additional improvements that can be made to certain components, but it's a good kicking-off point
for improving work and informing the path of further research.

### Focus State for Keyboards Only

Briefly mentioned above was the visible focus state for keyboard users, this is a frequently overlooked detail in a lot of user interfaces. There is
often a disproportionate amount of attention placed on the idea of users that are using a combination of a screen reader **and** using their
keyboard only, but there are also sighted users that exclusively use a keyboard for preference or any number of potential reasons. They miss out
on the visual indicator of the cursor on the screen indicating which element currently has focus.

Imagine you are looking at a row of 3 buttons and have no feedback to whether or not you are about to click the wrong one, or click one at all for that
matter.

The `:focus-visible` pseudo-selector can be used to create an outline (or alternative visual states) to indicate focus.

```css
button:focus-visible {
  outline: 3px solid #fff;
}
```

Just keep in mind the contrast ratio considerations above apply to focus states and outlines as well.

## 6. Use Anchors and Buttons Appropriately

Heavily JavaScript driven front-ends increased the number of mishaps in this regard.
The ability to attach a click handler to just about anything has led to some less-than-ideal
solutions. For example, this is a pattern that I see frequently in React:

```jsx
function DeleteIcon() {
  return(
    <div>
      <img src="./delete_icon.svg" onClick={deleteItem}>
    </div>;
  );
}
```

A screen reader will not be aware of what the image is or that it is click enabled, it will simply read "image". By contrast,

```jsx
function DeleteIcon() {
  return(
    <button onClick={deleteItem}>
      <img src="./delete_icon.svg" alt="Delete Item">
    </div>;
  );
}
```

This will properly be identified as a button so that the user not only realizes there is a button with behavior behind a click, but they can also
infer what action will be produced. To re-iterate on some earlier ideas, this is a good example of my claim "accessible-first development" because
option 2 does not take any more time than option 1, but is significantly more accessible. You also get the keyboard behavior, again for free, by using
a platform primitive.

The general rule of thumb that has served me well is to utilize a button if the action is an on-page change, and an anchor if I am routing the user
to a different URI. To clarify, I am not referring to the styles. For example, you could still style your anchor tag to appear like a button. Any
framework I have used with a built-in concept of a Link component like Gatsby or Next renders as an anchor tag, so you don't need to worry about
using those.

## 7. Build Forms for All Users

Someone may want to debate me on this, but I think that forms may possibly be the second most important thing on the internet after content.
Without the ability to capture user input in a form, the overwhelming majority of applications would not be possible. But as critical as their
importance is, they are often done in a way that could be improved.

### Labeling

A good chunk of the issues I observe with forms come down to form inputs just not being correctly labeled. Whether this be because the inputs
have an icon like a telephone next to them, are labeled by the placeholder, or there is a visual label that is just not programmatically associated
with it's respective input. There is a lot of flexibility here, and I've never noticed a difference in interpretation by assistive technology, so
any of these would be valid:

```html
<!-- Option 1 -->
<label>
  First Name:
  <input type="text" id="first_name" name="first_name" />
</label>

<!-- Option 2 -->
<label for="first_name">First Name</label>
<input type="text" id="first_name" name="first_name" />

<!-- Option 3 -->
<input type="text" id="first_name" name="first_name" aria-label="First Name" />

<!-- Option 4 -->
<label id="name_label">First Name</label>
<input
  type="text"
  id="first_name"
  name="first_name"
  aria-labeledby="name_label"
/>
```

I'm partial to option 2 personally, but there are benefits to other approaches like using `aria-labeledby` to combine multiple labels together into
a singular accessible label.

### Keyboard Control

Re-visiting #5, the form should be able to be navigated backwards and forwards with
a keyboard, input, and submitted via a keyboard. The platform, unless we deviate,
will typically address this for us. The biggest thing to watch out for that I see
broken most frequently, especially on JavaScript driven forms is ensuring that the
submit button can be triggered both directly or via enter while focused on a form
element. Naturally, pressing enter prematurely may require error handling.

### Error Handling

Even if you plan to use your own custom validation or validation rolled into a form library for your stack of choice. You should still use
HTML5 validation properties when it makes sense. For example, if your input actually has the required property, then a screen reader will actually
announce that it is a required input when it reads its label.

HTML5 validation by default will also announce to the user that the validation has failed letting them know what went wrong. This is a surprisingly
deep topic of potential options, but an easy first step is ensure the area where your error is rendered has the ARIA role of "alert" so assistive
technology will inform the user.

Errors should always be clear to their nature, text simply being red or a form being outlined is not sufficient by its self. More on that soon.

## 8. Test with an Actual Screen Reader

This one is actually short and sweet. As mentioned earlier, automated testing tools like WAVE or aXe can only catch certain classes errors. To ensure
the best experience possible for your screen reader users, you need to actually test your site with a screen reader. The litmus test I usually ask of
people is to pull up their website or latest project, turn on their screen reader, and close their eyes. Then attempt to locate and submit the contact
form (or an equivalent action) by audio cues only.

A few popular options:

- [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/)
- [JAWS](https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/)
- [Orca](https://help.gnome.org/users/orca/stable/index.html.en)
- VoiceOver (built into MacOS)
- Narrator (built into Windows)

Just keep in mind that screen readers are similar to browsers in that they don't all behave 100% consistently given the same document.

## 9. Avoid Color & Imagery as the Sole Medium for Information

Using color or images as the sole mechanism by which information is conveyed to the user has some assumptions that are not necessarily
always true. The user may not be using your website visually at all, or they may be using the site visually but may not see the color
the same way you do.

There's nothing wrong with using color and images to create a compelling or functional design, but always strive to have the information
available outside of those. Like in the case of form errors, you can show your text in red or orange, and changing the outline color of the
input is fine; but there should also be a clear and concise text indication of what the error is as well.

Just be mindful of the point of diminishing or ill returns, for example, if you give an image an alt tag with **too much** information then it
becomes your sighted users that are missing out on potentially important context or information.

<a id="test" />
## 10. Research Third Party Components

Some components are notoriously hard to get right from an accessibility standpoint. There are some components, like a date picker, that I don't even feel
comfortable tackling, despite having a decent amount of experience in web development and accessibility. One easy way to improve accessibility
in a profound way very quickly is to stand on the shoulder of giants.

There are frameworks like [React UI](https://reach.tech/) and [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style/) where considerable amounts of thought, energy, and probably
a fair amount of sweat and tears went into making components that are accessible as possible. If you are unsure about a particular framework
or unsure how to best audit the accessibility of UI kit before committing, feel free to ask the community. A lot of us spend a considerable amount
of energy trying to advocate and educate on accessibility and we are overjoyed when someone shows an interest in improving their trade and are happy
to help.

To share a real world story, when I first began to focus heavily on accessibility work in 2021, one of the first major issues I found with my website
was the pop-out side menu. The package I was using was in poor shape on top of being abandoned. Focus was not handled correctly, a user could navigate by
tab to the menu when it was off-screen and inert, opening and closing state was not represented anywhere. The more I learned from APG and similar
documentation, the more I dreaded needing to rebuild my sidebar.

A co-worker advised me to give Chakra UI's sidebar a test drive, and low and behold, it checked every checkbox I was able to come across and only took
an hour and some change to transition over and retire my old menu.

## Conclusion

As I mentioned earlier, accessibility is a vast topic that a person could specialize exclusively in. So don't feel discouraged or intimidated
by the amount of knowledge out there. Start with items 1 through 10 above, and once you are feeling confident in your new approach and your
understandings of the whens and whys, peel back the next layer of the onion to level up your skill and make your work even more accessible.
